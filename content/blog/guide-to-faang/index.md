## Overview

After a while of on and off preparation, I decided to document my step by step guide from scratch on my (extremely slow) preparation process for big tech companies. After jumping straight into LeetCode (LC), Elements of Programming Interviews in Java (EPI), etc, I realized I wasn't being very efficient so I'll stick to one resource **Cracking the Coding Interview** (CTCI). This is will be a constantly updated article.

## Approach

Follow CTCI's logical workflow (Arrays and Strings, Linked Lists, etc.) and look at other resources as I'm moving forward.
 - HackerRank's Data Structures problems
 - William Fiset's Youtube Channel
 - Robert Lafore's Data Structures and Algorithms in Java
 - EPI's problems for the specific data structure
 - CTCI problems at the end of each chapter
 - Other potential useful resources

Then at the end of each chapter (or at the end of the first iteration) move on to LeetCode. Also use OneNote to take notes and an Excel spreadsheet to track LC problems.
